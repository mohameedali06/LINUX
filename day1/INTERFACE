INTERFACE IN JAVA:
INTERFACE:
		==>Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how,it is  defined as the blueprint of the class.
		==>An interface can have abstract methods and static constants.
		==>By using the interface, we can achieve abstraction in java.
		==>We can also achieve multiple inheritance in java using interface. 
		==>In java, the "interface" keyword is used to declare the interface.
		==>Like class, the interface can also inherit another interface by using "extends" keyword. However, a class "implements" the interface.
		==>An interface can have another interface which is known as a nested interface
		==>simple syntax : interface <interface_name>{  
								// declare constant fields  
								// declare methods that abstract   
								// by default.  
						   }

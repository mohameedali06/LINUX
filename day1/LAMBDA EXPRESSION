Java Lambda Expressions :

	==>A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
	==>Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
	==>It is very useful in collection library. It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.
	==>Java lambda expression is treated as a function, so compiler does not create .class file.
	==>The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface.
	==>It saves a lot of code
	==>lambda expression syntax :
			Java lambda expression is consisted of three components.
				1) Argument-list: It can be empty or non-empty as well.
				2) Arrow-token: It is used to link arguments-list and body of expression.
				3) Body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda expression.
						syntax : (argument-list) -> {body}  
						* No Parameter Syntax
							() -> {  
								//Body of no parameter lambda  
							} 
						*One Parameter Syntax
							(p1) ->{  
									//Body of single parameter lambda  
							}  
						*Two Parameter Syntax
							(p1,p2) -> {  
									//Body of multiple parameter lambda  
							}
